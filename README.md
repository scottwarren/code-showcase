## Project Showcase

This project's goal is to showcase (and improve) my development skills. While originally the project code was used as a part of a technical interview, I have used it as a base to improve upon.

Original project instructions [here](coding-exercise-selected.pdf)

### Technologies

- Frontend
  - React
  - Redux (state management)
  - SCSS
- API
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (Database)
  - Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)
- Testing
  - Cypress (End-to-end testing)
  - Jest (Component and unit testing)

## Setup

This project is stored as a monorepo, to group the code as a showcase (I tried to avoid 'bikeshedding' about the decision).

For more detailed setup information, see the individual project's readme folder.

### Global Dependency Information

- Node
  - Version I have installed: `10.11.0`
- NVM
  - Version I have installed: `0.33.2`
  - Why: Using NVM to keep the Node versions between the frontend and backend consistent
