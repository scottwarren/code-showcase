## Project Showcase

This project's goal is to showcase (and improve) my development skills. While originally the project code was used as a part of a technical interview, I have used it as a base to improve upon.

### Technologies

* Frontend
  * React
  * Redux (state management)
  * SCSS
* API
  * Node.js
  * Express
  * MongoDB (Database)
  * Mongoose (MongoDB ORM)
* Testing
  * Cypress (End-to-end testing)
  * Jest (Component and unit testing)

## Setup 

This project is stored as a monorepo, to group the code as a showcase (trying to avoid bikeshedding about the decision).

For more detailed setup information, see the individual project's readme folder.

### Global Dependency Information

* Node
  * Version I have installed: `v8.12.0` -- latest LTS of version 8
* NVM
  * Version I have installed: `0.33.2`
  * Why: Using NVM to manage Node version's between the frontend and backend
* Nodemon
  * Version: I have installed: `1.18.4`
  * Why: Nodemon runs locally and updates the API upon API file changes -- useful for development
