## Frontend

Bootstrapped using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Frontend and API code for the project exercise portion of the Get Selected interview process.

Monorepo setup to (hopefully) simplify the frontend and API setup for this specific project.

I've made the assumption that MongoDB is installed and running locally.

Based on the document provided for this project, I didn't appear to require the `invites` API endpoint, and thus I have left this out of the code completed.

### Setup

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the local server
